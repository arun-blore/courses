1. Decision trees need discrete inputs. The twitter dataset contains integers and floating point values which need to be discretized.
2. I need an easy way to describe the range of values. Some experimentation will be required to arrive at the best ranges.
3. To make this easy, I will create a feature description file that contains info about how each feature is discretized.
4. File name is feature_desc.txt.
5. Any line beginning with a # is a comment.
6. For each feature, the following information needs to be captured:
    1. What is the index of the feature in the .train file?
        id:
    2. A short string (max len 10) that describes the feature.
        desc:
    3. A list of ranges that discretize the feature.
    4. A short string that describes the range.
        range: a1,b1,s1 ; a2,b2,s1 ; 
        the above range means
            range1 - a1 <= feature < b1 with a description s1
            range2 - a2 <= feature < b2 with a description s2
            if either a1 or b1 is 'x', there is no lower/upper bound
